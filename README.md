### Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program
#### Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone
You will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.
### How to play:
* Your goal is to cross safely
* Move player with arrow keys or click around player in a + shape (only one tile each time):
  - if a bug hits the player, player dies
  - if player reaches water, score increases & game loops
* Game ends if you lose all your lives
* Score as much as you can!
